# Movie-Recommender-System
➡️ How does the movie recommendation system work?
Every recommender system primarily consists of two components: users and items. Users receive movie predictions from the system, and the actual movies are the products.
Filtering and predicting only the movies that a matching user is most likely to wish to see is the main objective of movie recommendation systems. The user information from the system's database is used by the ML algorithms for these recommendation systems. Based on information from the past, this data is used to forecast the user in question's behavior in the future.
